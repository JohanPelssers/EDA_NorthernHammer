Codecademy Bootcamp - Data Analysis with AI - Assignment 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis &amp; Churn Analysis

The aim for this assigment is to use python, pandas, numpy and visualisation libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) to do exploratory data analysis. My personal focus in this exercise is on developing the technical skills, over the analytical skills.  

For simulation, I chose to do the Churn and Regional Sales Analysis for a fictional company, Northern Hammer, a retailer in hardware tools. In the churn analysis, the aim is to determine which variables causes subcribers of the DIY TV channel of Northern Hammer to churn. In the Regional Sales Analysis, the aim is to do an exploratory data analysis of a order dataset to gather useful insights on the sales and profits of Northern Hammer. 

Any similarities to real persons, companies, or events are purely coincidental.
